# Solar-to-iCalendar
Exports Schedule from Stony Brook's Solar to iCalendar format

_This is an addon to RateSBU_

#What it does?
This extension exports schedule from Stony Brook University's Solar system in ics format so you can import it to your favorite calendar service.
  1. Adds a button in Solar that invokes and scrapes all the schedule
  2. Creates event in ics standard format
  3. Exports to file system
  
#Why?
1. Stony Brook doesn't have a way to import class schedule to calendar service i.e Google Calendar -> even though they heavily rely on google services
2. I'm lazy and manually adding each class schedule to calendar is a waste of time
